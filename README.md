# SmartHack 2023 project

## Description

This repo contains the source code for our SmartHack 2023 project, an application used for the digitalization / automation of the procurement process.

It provides an interface for managing an organization's annual procurement plan, computing a budget estimate, generating e-mails for requesting price estimates, generating documents used in the tendering process (descriptions, specifications), provides analytics and feedback to the overall procurement pipeline.

It uses the [Veridion](https://veridion.com/) API to query a list of companies offering the desired products/services and Machine Learning (Natural Language Processing) to parse natural language queries, generate e-mails (requesting cost estimates), provide feedback and generate procurement documents.
